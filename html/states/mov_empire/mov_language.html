  <h2 class="title2">Language</h2>
  <div class="legend">
    <p class="legend-text-left">
      The language of the Mov Empire is a refined and elegant form of communication, befitting their noble status and aristocratic sensibilities. Known as Movarian, it is a language that carries an air of sophistication and exclusivity. To the untrained ear, the cadence of Movarian may sound melodic, with its graceful intonations and carefully crafted pronunciations.<br><br>
        Movarian is a language deeply rooted in tradition and hierarchy. It reflects the social structure of the empire, with different linguistic nuances and vocabulary reserved for each level of society. The nobility speak with a distinct accent, employing elaborate phrases and precise diction to emphasize their elevated status. In contrast, the common folk speak a simplified version of the language, often incorporating local dialects and colloquial expressions.<br><br>
        Written Movarian is equally intricate, employing a script that combines flowing curves and intricate symbols. It is a language of precision, where every stroke and curve holds meaning and significance. The written word is revered and used extensively in official documents, historical records, and literary works, preserving the culture and history of the Mov Empire.<br><br>
        While the Mov nobility take great pride in their language, it is also a tool of control and suppression. The ban on non-Mov races learning magic extends to the language itself, with severe penalties imposed upon those who dare to speak or write in Movarian without permission. This further reinforces the power dynamics and exclusivity within the empire, ensuring that the language remains a stronghold of the noble elite.<br><br>
     Movarian serves as a symbol of privilege and authority, a linguistic barrier that reinforces the societal divide between the Mov and the subjugated races. Yet, hidden within the complexities of their language, lies the potential for unity and resistance. The forbidden whispers and secret conversations amongst those who seek liberation fuel the flickering flames of hope, as they strive to reclaim the language and their own voices in the face of oppression.

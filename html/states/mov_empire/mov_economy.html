      <h2 class="title2">Economy and Trade</h2>
      <div class="legend">
        <p class="legend-text-left">
          Within the grand Mov Empire, the economy thrives on a system of trade and exploitation. The noble Mov, with their purple skin and elevated status, control the majority of wealth and resources, ensuring their dominance and opulence. The empire's economic power stems from the exploitation of conquered territories and the subjugation of other races, whose labor is harnessed to fuel the empire's prosperity.<br><br>
        Trade is heavily regulated and monopolized by the Mov nobility, who dictate the terms and conditions to their advantage. The empire's vast territories provide access to valuable resources such as rare minerals, exquisite textiles, and exotic spices, which are traded with neighboring realms for wealth and influence. However, the Mov's control over trade extends beyond mere commodities. They also leverage their dominance to secure political alliances and extend their imperial reach, further solidifying their hold on power.<br><br>
        The trade routes of the Mov Empire are guarded by a formidable military force, ensuring the safety and security of precious goods as they traverse treacherous lands. The bustling marketplaces within the empire's grand cities serve as centers of commerce, with merchants from far and wide flocking to display their wares. While the Mov reap the benefits of this thriving economy, the other races within the empire often find themselves marginalized, relegated to menial labor and subservient roles in the economic hierarchy.<br><br>
        The economy of the Mov Empire stands as a testament to their dominion, where wealth is amassed through control, exploitation, and the unequal distribution of resources. As they seek to expand their empire and subjugate the Cynocephali Confederacy, their insatiable hunger for power and wealth drives them forward, leaving a trail of oppression and conquest in their wake.

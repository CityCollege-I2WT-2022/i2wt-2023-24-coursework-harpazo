  <h1 class="title animate__animated animate__fadeInDown animate__delay-1s">Mov Empire</h1>

  <h2 class="title2">Culture</h2>
  <div class="legend">
    <p class="legend-text-left">
      The culture of the noble Mov within the grand empire is a tapestry woven with opulence, power, and a strict hierarchical structure. Drawing inspiration from the splendor of the Byzantine aristocracy, the Mov embrace an extravagant lifestyle that showcases their superiority and dominance. Their palaces are adorned with intricate mosaics, shimmering tapestries, and gilded ornaments, reflecting their wealth and refined tastes.<br><br>
      Social etiquette and formalities hold great importance within Mov society. Elaborate ceremonies and grand banquets are common occurrences, where the elite gather to display their wealth and influence. The Mov nobility prides themselves on their refined manners, eloquent speech, and impeccable fashion sense. Lavish garments, embellished with intricate embroidery and adorned with gemstones, are worn as symbols of their status and privilege.<br><br>
      Art and music flourish in the Mov Empire, with renowned painters, sculptors, and musicians showcasing their talents to the delight of the noble elite. The arts serve as a means of expressing the grandeur and sophistication of the Mov culture, often depicting scenes from their glorious history or religious legends. Poetry and literature also hold a special place, with epic tales and romantic verses celebrated and recited during grand gatherings.<br><br>
      However, beneath the facade of extravagance, a dark undercurrent of power and oppression exists. The Mov nobility, with their disdain for other races, perpetuate a rigid caste system that places humans and other races beneath them. This social hierarchy is deeply ingrained in Mov society, creating a stark divide between the privileged nobility and the subjugated masses.<br><br>
      The culture of the Mov Empire, with its ostentatious displays of wealth and power, mirrors the complex nature of their rule. While they bask in opulence and revel in their dominance, the seeds of rebellion and resistance quietly grow, as those oppressed yearn to overthrow the shackles of their Mov overlords and reclaim their own destinies.<br><br>
      For the humans living within the empire, life is difficult. That’s not to say that it is unlivable. While they couldn’t dare to think they would ever gain similar status as the mov, the can still rise through the ranks through tremendous effort. Many talented humans are employed as marshalls, scribes, courtesans and other occupations.<br><br>

  <h1 class="title animate__animated animate__fadeInDown animate__delay-1s">Cynocephali Confederacy</h1>

  <h2 class="title2 animate__animated animate__fadeInDown animate__delay-2s">Culture</h2>
  <div class="legend">
    <p class="legend-text-left">
      Cynocephali culture varies greatly from pack to pack and breed to breed. Some breeds are more aggressive and
      warlike, prefering to hunt for their food, while others prefer to keep to themselves and herd livestock.
      One thing all packs have in common is their love of freedom.
      <br><br>
      The Cynocephali Confederacy, bound by the trials of history and a shared vision of survival, boasts a rich and
      resilient culture that mirrors the strength of its people. In the wake of their unification against the
      existential threats of the Mov and Yek, the Cynocephali have woven a tapestry of traditions, customs, and beliefs
      that celebrate their autonomy, honor their diverse heritage, and commemorate their journey from discord to unity.
      <br><br>
      The core tenet of Cynocephali culture within the Confederacy revolves around the delicate balance between autonomy
      and unity. Each pack retains a degree of independence, nurturing its unique identity and traditions. However, when
      the Councils of Howls convene, the leaders set aside differences, embracing a collective identity that transcends
      individual packs. This duality is symbolized in their artwork, with depictions of intertwining canine and human
      figures representing unity amid diversity.
      <br><br>
      The biannual Councils of Howls stand as the epicenter of Cynocephali governance and cultural exchange. Held in a
      sacred clearing surrounded by ancient trees, the leaders gather to discuss matters of diplomacy, defense, and
      shared prosperity. The councils are not only a platform for strategic discussions but also a celebration of
      Cynocephali diversity, where each pack showcases its unique talents, crafts, and cultural contributions.
      <br><br>
      The Cynocephali are renowned for their artistic prowess, reflecting the intricate tapestry of their cultural
      heritage. Intricately carved totems, adorned with symbols of their pack's history and achievements, dot the
      landscapes. The weaving of intricate patterns into garments and tapestries is a revered skill, passed down through
      generations. Artistic expression is not only a form of storytelling but a source of pride, reflecting the
      resilience of a people who have overcome internal strife.
      <br><br>
      Festivals and rituals play a crucial role in Cynocephali culture, marking important milestones in the
      Confederacy's history and the lives of its individuals. The Festival of Unity, held every decade, commemorates the
      signing of the pact that birthed the Confederacy. During this time, packs exchange gifts, share stories, and
      engage in friendly competitions that reinforce the bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood.
      <br><br>
      Embedded in the fabric of Cynocephali culture is a deep respect for nature and an unwavering commitment to
      adaptability. Having once lived in diverse terrains, each pack brings unique survival skills to the Confederacy.
      The teachings of the elders emphasize the importance of resourcefulness, ensuring that the Cynocephali remain
      resilient in the face of external threats.
      <br><br>
      The oral tradition is the heartbeat of Cynocephali culture, with stories, myths, and legends passed down through
      generations. Elders gather the young around roaring fires to share tales of ancient heroes, epic battles, and the
      triumph of unity over discord. These stories not only entertain but instill a sense of identity and purpose in the
      hearts of the Cynocephali.
      <br><br>
      As the Cynocephali Confederacy continues to thrive, its culture stands as a testament to the strength that arises
      when diverse voices harmonize. Through their art, rituals, and shared narratives, the Cynocephali celebrate their
      past, navigate their present, and forge a resilient path into an uncertain future.

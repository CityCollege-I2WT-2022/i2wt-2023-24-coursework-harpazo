<h1 class="title animate__animated animate__fadeInDown animate__delay-1s">Cynocephali Confederacy</h1>

<h2 class="title2 animate__animated animate__fadeInDown animate__delay-2s">History</h2>
<div class="legend">
  <p class="legend-text-left">Originally they were dozens of independent packs fighting each other for territory, but
    with the growing
    threats of the Mov to their East and Yek to their West who have already conquered and enslaved many of their
    kin, they decided to come to an agreement and unite against those threats to protect themselves.
    <br><br>
    In the heart of a sprawling and untamed realm, where dense forests whispered ancient tales and towering
    mountains stood as silent witnesses, the Cynocephali Confederacy emerged—a testament to unity forged in the
    crucible of adversity. The Cynocephali, a race distinguished by the unique combination of canine heads atop
    human bodies, once roamed as numerous independent packs, each fiercely guarding its own swath of territory.
    <br><br>
    For ages, these packs engaged in perpetual strife, territorial disputes echoing through the vast wilderness. The
    Cynocephali, marked by a deeply ingrained sense of autonomy, lived by the primal code of survival—fiercely
    defending their lands and resources. It was a world where alliances were fleeting, and the bonds of kinship were
    often overshadowed by the instinctual drive for dominance.
    <br><br>
    However, looming threats from the East and West, embodied by the relentless Mov and the encroaching Yek, cast a
    shadow over the once-disjointed packs. The Mov, a formidable civilization, advanced with an insatiable appetite
    for conquest, enslaving many Cynocephali kin in its wake. Simultaneously, the Yek, a force equally menacing,
    sought dominion over vast territories, subjugating the once-independent packs to a life of servitude.
    <br><br>
    In the face of this dual menace, the Cynocephali packs recognized the imperative for a collective response. The
    leaders of each pack, wise and battle-hardened, convened in a momentous council held twice a year—a gathering
    that would determine the fate of their kind. In these grand assemblies, known as the "Councils of Howls,"
    leaders discussed matters of common concern, negotiated treaties, and deliberated on strategies to withstand the
    encroaching Mov and Yek.
    <br><br>
    The decision to unite and form the Cynocephali Confederacy was not without its challenges. Each leader
    relinquished a portion of their pack's autonomy for the sake of a greater, shared purpose—to protect their
    kindred from the impending doom that threatened to erase the essence of their existence.
    <br><br>
    The Confederacy, symbolized by a banner adorned with canine and human silhouettes intertwined, stood as a
    bulwark against the advancing forces. The once-disparate packs now marched in unison, their collective strength
    a formidable barrier against the Mov and Yek. The Councils of Howls, though rooted in tradition, became a
    crucible of diplomacy and solidarity.
    <br><br>
    Through this unity, the Cynocephali Confederacy not only resisted the external threats but also found strength
    in their diversity. The bonds forged in the fires of adversity transformed them from a collection of warring
    packs into a resilient and united nation, where the howls of each pack echoed not in conflict but in harmony—a
    testament to the enduring spirit of the Cynocephali.

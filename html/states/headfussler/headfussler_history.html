  <h2 class="title2">History and Politics</h2>
  <div class="legend">
    <p class="legend-text-left">
      It was in the Yek invasion and the scouring of the Northern Basin that the Headfusslers emerged as a region-wide
      scourge.<br><br>
      Emerging at some point in prior centuries in the north being a minor issue in the far south, they were treated as
      a minor pest, usually restrained to the once thinned forests. With exceptions.
      Sometimes grown Headfusslers could be pacified and utilized by careful community growth, allowing skilled Fusslers
      to perform their peculiar roles or warriors to defend farms and villas.
      While the human inhabitants of the basin were exterminated or displaced, the forests, cities, and farmland were
      burned, razing most of the Northern Basin region.<br><br>

      This would ultimately lead to the 'Great Fussling' as the fires drove the prior disunited Fusslers together,
      amalgamating their aggression and focus to prior unimagined levels.
      Of the 79 calamities, few were as deranged and horrifying as the Fussler tide that fell upon the Yek armies. A
      wall of headmen, stretching as tall as a castle wall rolled over much of the coast,
      devouring and smothering all but the few who managed to escape.<br><br>

      Following the Yek collapse, no power could challenge the innumerable and mindless Fusslers for their kingdom, and
      they remain there to date, imitating a lifestyle with greater fidelity than their human neighbors.

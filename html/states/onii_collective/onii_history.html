  <h2 class="title2">History</h2>
  <div class="legend">
    <p class="legend-text-left">
      The nomadic origins of the Onii are etched into the collective memory, and ancient artifacts, carefully preserved
      in arboreal archives, tell stories of their journey. The Elder Council, seated within a sacred grove, not only
      guides political decisions but also serves as the living repository of ancestral wisdom. The decision-making
      process involves a ritualistic dance, where council members weave intricate patterns symbolizing unity and
      consensus. The council's deliberations take place in a Hall of Echoes, a structure designed to amplify the
      harmonious discussions. The Onii practice a unique form of oral history, where storytellers weave sagas using
      luminescent scrolls that illuminate the darkened groves during communal gatherings.<br><br>

      The Eldertrees, towering giants with roots entwined in the ancient soil, serve as both witnesses and chroniclers
      of the Onii's history. Their bark, etched with ancient carvings, tells tales of triumphs, trials, and the cyclical
      dance of life. On special occasions, the Onii gather around these Eldertrees, engaging in ceremonies where the
      elders interpret the carvings, relaying the stories to the younger generation. The Eldertrees are considered the
      living archives, and it is believed that those who listen to their whispers gain wisdom and a deeper understanding
      of the Onii's journey.<br><br>

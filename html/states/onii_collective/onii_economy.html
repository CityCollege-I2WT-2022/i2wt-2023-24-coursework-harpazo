  <h2 class="title2">Economy and Trade</h2>
  <div class="legend">
    <p class="legend-text-left">
      Within the Onii Collective, the economy is a reflection of their commitment to sustainability, cooperation, and
      the delicate balance between nature and commerce. Guided by principles that honor the sanctity of the land, the
      Onii engage in practices that ensure both prosperity and the preservation of their enchanted realm.<br><br>

      At the heart of the Onii economy lies 'Harmonic Horticulture,' a method that aligns the cultivation of crops with
      lunar cycles. This meticulous approach enhances the growth and nutritional value of their harvests, ensuring a
      bountiful yield while maintaining the ecological equilibrium. Lumifields, expansive gardens illuminated by
      bioluminescent flora, serve not only as a source of sustenance but also as a testament to the Onii's reverence for
      the interconnectedness of all living things. The luminescent plants, carefully tended to in patterns that mimic
      constellations, create a mesmerizing display that symbolizes the harmonious dance between the celestial and
      earthly realms.<br><br>

      The Onii possess an intimate knowledge of herbal remedies and natural medicines, cultivating a variety of herbs in
      a practice known as 'Crestwood Cultivation.' These medicinal plants are planted in patterns that mirror the
      constellations, believed to infuse them with celestial energy and enhance their healing properties. The Onii's
      proficiency in herbalism extends beyond their borders, as they engage in trade with neighboring realms, exchanging
      their sacred remedies for goods that are scarce within their enchanted domain.<br><br>

      Trade within the Onii Collective is a harmonious affair facilitated by Lumicaravans, carriages adorned with
      glowing motifs that traverse the lands. These caravans serve as emissaries of the Onii's cooperative spirit,
      carrying not just goods but also the luminescent essence of their enchanted realm to distant lands. In exchange
      for their unique products, the Onii acquire resources that may be rare within their own borders, fostering a fair
      and cooperative approach to commerce. The Lumicaravans, adorned with symbols representing the natural elements,
      embody the interconnected tapestry of trade and harmony woven by the Onii. The Onii's economy is a testament to
      their belief that prosperity should not come at the expense of the natural world. By cultivating a sustainable and
      cooperative economic model, they ensure the enduring magic of their realm while fostering meaningful connections
      with neighboring civilizations. In this way, the Lumifields glow not just with the light of nature but with the
      luminescent exchange of goods and ideas that enrich the Onii Collective and the realms beyond.
